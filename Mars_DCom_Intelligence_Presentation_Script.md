## **Advanced Analytics & Predictive Intelligence (2.5 minutes)**

### **Channel Deep Dive & Predictive Performance**

"Now let's explore our advanced analytics capabilities that set us apart in the industry.

**[Navigate to Channel Deep Dive]**

Our Channel Deep Dive shows the sophisticated analysis we're conducting:

- **Search Performance Intelligence**: We track keyword performance with 18% PDP traffic growth quarter-over-quarter, with specific ROI analysis for each search term
- **Media Impact Timeline**: Our AI analyzes the optimal timing for media investments, showing how different timing strategies yield varying incremental returns
- **Retailer Performance Heatmaps**: Week-by-week performance mapping across all major retailers, identifying optimization opportunities

**[Navigate to Predictive Performance]**

But here's where we truly lead the industry - our Predictive Performance Intelligence:

- **6-Month Forecasting**: Our models predict GSV performance with 87% accuracy, showing baseline, optimistic, and risk scenarios
- **Strategic Lever Simulation**: Marketing teams can simulate the impact of media spend changes, pricing adjustments, and promotion intensity before implementation
- **Driver/Drainer Analysis**: We identify exactly what's accelerating growth (seasonal demand +85%, media investment +72%) versus what's constraining it (competition pressure -38%)

**Business Impact**: This means we're not just reacting to market changes - we're anticipating them and optimizing our strategies before our competitors even know what's happening."

## **AI-Powered Strategic Insights (1.5 minutes)**

### **From Data to Decision**

"Let me show you our AI Insights engine - this is where data becomes strategic advantage.

**[Navigate to AI Insights]**

Our AI continuously analyzes patterns and provides three types of intelligence:

**Strategic Reasoning**: For example, our AI identified that Gum category outperformance is driven by three specific factors: media timing optimization capturing 85% of back-to-school traffic, 23% improvement in shelf execution, and strong retailer velocity correlation.

**Actionable Recommendations**: Each insight comes with specific, prioritized actions - like our current Amazon Recovery Initiative with $1.2M GSV recovery potential and clear ownership assignments.

**Implementation Tracking**: Our 30/60/90 day plans show exactly how insights translate into business results, with real-time progress tracking and accountability.

**Industry Leadership**: Most analytics platforms tell you what happened. Our AI tells you why it happened, what's going to happen next, and exactly what to do about it."
